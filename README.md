# bee
üêùA simple Unity sketch game i made while trying to understand the basics of unity and C#.

## Here are the key mechanics implemented 
### The bee
* The bee is the main character of the sketch. You can control it using the standard WASD key binding.

### Plants 
* Plants will grow two different power-ups: nectar and pollen.
* Each of these has a different growing time and upon completion can be harvested by entering the harvest collision zone with the bee.

### Collect Zone

### Collecting the resources
* To collect the resources, the bee must remain inside the collection zone for a set time. (In this example it is 5 seconds)

## The goal is to keep collecting pollen and nectar to return it to the beehive
* Right now, the resources are being logged out to the console, but later could be implemented inside the GUI.
